This is the repository for the research about climate ergodic
## Data Sets
Weather data resource: [Princeton Hyfrology dataset](http://hydrology.princeton.edu/data/pgf/)  

All data sets needed have been uploaded on the Kaggle: [Data sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chenyangong/ergodic-weather).  
Please click Raw_Data to enter the data set.  
  
  The data set contains four sub-folders:  
  
    1. Chinese_Map: This is the shapefile for Chinese boundary  
    2. Elevation: This is the elevation map of the whole world  
    3. Presciption_monthly: This is the monthly prescipitation data from 1901 to 2012  
    4. Temperature_monthly: This is the monthly temperature data from 1901 to 2012  

## Code
There are three files in the code folder:  

    1. Temp_mon_H: Calculate the hurst coefficient of monthly temperature.  
    2. Pre_mon_H: Calculate the hurst coefficient of monthly prescipition.  
    3. Code.Rroject: The R project
  
## Output
There is a output folder which contains all the output file:  

    1. Pre_H: The hurst coefficient of monthly precipitation
    2. Tem_H: The hurst coefficient of monthly temperature
